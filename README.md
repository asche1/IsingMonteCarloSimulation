# Ising Monte Carlo Simulation
Python code for simulating the square lattice Ising model in 2D

Created for Oleg Tchernyshyov's phase transitions class, summer 2018 by Allen Scheie

This code is an example of optimization using Numba's @jitclass. By itself the code ran pretty slowly, but adding @jitclass sped up the computation time by a factor of 47.
